i feel like the only thing that really counts as oppenheimer spoilers is like the framing of certain shots and the sound design
the content of the movie absolutely can’t count as a spoiler
SPOILER there’s a character called einstein idk if anyone has heard of him
basically oppenheimer (a physicist who brought quantum mechanics to america and laid the groundwork for the discovery of black holes) was hired by the US govt during WW2 to oversee the manhattan project (building the atomic bombs to drop on japan)
what kind of math
only divisible by 1 and itself!
my degree plan of unspeakable horrors
physics has 9 more classes than astrophysics
astrophysics has 7 more classes than physics
idk how many classes overlap but they have 16 classes not in common
LMAO I would but im about to leave soon
it’s my roommates birthday and we’re going to something called meowwolf
I can’t get the webpage to load so I guess I’ll never know but it’s this https://meowwolf.com/
apparently it’s like a life size house filled with things that suggest a storyline and there are like secret rooms??
woah those are so unique! ive never seen anything like those
it’s funny cause the cockroaches would be able to survive the atomic bomb
i believe in their ability to survive
spoilered because they’re scary
luckily for you this isn’t an insect! it’s an arachnid!
these things are the size of my hand too
they’re pretty big
idk a spider/scorpion the size of a small hand is still terrifying
i do have long fingers tho
ahhh right yes but that doesn’t really count as “vc”
that’s like vc++
with a purpose
wait when is d&d
ah i don’t think i can join that weekend lol that’s when im traveling but i can do the weekend after
it’s at like 10 or 11 EST right
or am I totally off
okay i see
I need to give my character a backstory or personality or anything at all
improvisation
jupiter (i went there to get more stupider)
I think ash will have fun making sense of things that i say
oh no don’t make ash upset
he will go hulk mode or something actually idk what he does when upset
woww
lmao i felt that
“when can you vc”
“im in the new mexico wilderness for 2 months”
if everything goes right in my life i will never be back in new mexico
u know about stars
they shine
sparkly
tbf you just got here
did you know that up to 85% of stars are in binary systems
so whenever you look up at the sky and see a star, know that it’s likely actually 2 of them
NO WAY
im pretty sure i joined this server when i was in new mexico too 💀💀💀💀 why am i always in new mexico 💀
when was this server created
yeah im working at the same place this year just on a different project
oh so i only missed like a year
how did you assemble this group of people actually like where did you meet
did you break off from a larger server
yeah so the solar system is actually more rare because the sun is not in a binary
most exoplanets would have two suns
FAST TYPING
story time!!!!!!! :KurisuSip:
you guys already know how i met ash and got added so now i get to hear the other backstory
i rememebr when I added ash to my discord server of irl friends and we just adopted him as if he went to school with us
I KNEW it would be a date server
**fate
not date server
ong
LOL
yeah unfortunately that irl server died and got deleted when we all graduated and left
so RIP
ash is so good at just meeting people
fr
how does he do it
i feel like one day i will get voted off the island
im gonna get like sacrificed in a coup cause ive never read fate
not of the male orientation LMFAOOOO
i got mistaken as a boy at age like 12-14 cause i cut all my hair off
then i would speak and they’d be like aaah girl voice
it was kind of fun
I love trolling just a little bit
i like to imagine you had a court session like phoenix wright with everyone arguing pros and cons
like there’s a court dissent document somewhere that’s like 50 pages of discussion
official court ruling: “taylor is da homie, case dismissed”
oh?? story time??
NOOOOOOO
