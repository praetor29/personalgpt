## About this branch
This development effort seeks to bring the codebase up to speed with the latest [OpenAI Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) library.
With experience gained through many months of beta testing and feedback, this new branch will reflect better coding practices and organization, designed for multimodal functionality from the ground up.

## Objectives
The primary goal is to reach an **all-round appearance of "sentience"** (as close as possible), with the following features in the pipeline:
- Discord VC support (Whisper/ElevenLabs API)
- Image recognition (GPT-4 Vision)
- Image generation (DALLE-3)
- Ability to run python code (maybe)
- External APIs function calling
- Reactions
- Schedule-based probability function for message follow-ups
