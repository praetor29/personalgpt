## About
PersonalGPT is a groundbreaking project that harnesses state-of-the-art AI to create an immersive digital clone. Its multifaceted approach offers a unique and interactive experience across various mediums.

### Core Features:
- **Finetuning Support:** Leverages `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` fine-tuned models for exceptional user mimicry, ensuring high personalization and response accuracy.
- **GPT-4 Vision:** Utilizes `gpt-4-vision-preview` for advanced **image recognition**, offering top-tier capabilities in visual data analysis.
- **Configurable Memory:** Features a robust `asyncio` queue, applying a **First In, First Out** (FIFO) strategy for consistent and lossless data management.
- **Fully Asynchronous Processing:** Efficiently handles high volumes of concurrent messages, maintaining seamless performance.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Provides comprehensive customization through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and an intuitive configuration file.
- **Discord Voice Chat (In Development):** Integrates OpenAI's `whisper-1` STT and ElevenLab's TTS technologies for a novel audio conversation experience on Discord.

> [!NOTE]
> The `active-dev` branch is focused on upgrading the codebase to align with [OpenAI Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) library's new `SDK v1` release.

## Objectives
