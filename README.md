The project aims to create a Discord bot that utilizes the OpenAI API to sustain intelligent, high caliber conversation using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) python library.

## Features
- Short Term Memory
- 100% asynchronous
- Customizable parameters
- Runs on OpenAI's `gpt-4-turbo` model

### Please Be Aware
This project is **self-hosted.** It requires an active OpenAI billing account and Discord API keys.

> [!WARNING]
> `cognition.py` is severely out of date with the latest OpenAI python implementation. Will be looking to rewrite large chunks of it from the ground up. Lots coming up in the pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> While the code is available on the repository, a few files are missing (data folder and prompts) for privacy reasons during testing. The code governing this needs to be reworked to facilitate easier use. This `README` also lacks an installation guide for anyone wishing to replicate.
